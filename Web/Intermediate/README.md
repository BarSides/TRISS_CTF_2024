## Challenge

File Manager Platinum Pro++ (FMPP++) is a revolutionary, next platform for sharing files.  Unfortunately,
it may also contain some vulnerabilities as well as sharing some malicious files.  As part of your
security assessment, you must exploit a vulnerability in FMPP++ and recover the flag from the malicious
file.

## Setup

1.  Run the application: `docker compose up`.
1.  Navigate to `127.0.0.1:8001` in your browser.
1.  Login with the following credentials:

Username: Beatriss

Password: Triss2024

## Hints

- Getting the malicious file should be the first step.
- The malicious file is a script of some kind, and it has the appropriate file extension.
- Make sure to check all data structures when running the script.
